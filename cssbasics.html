<h1 class="center">Moral & Ethical Issues With Computing</h1>
<p>In this document we will cover some of the new and immerging issues when it comes to computing
, This includes information from people creating new software to take over peoples jobs in the future
all the way to people using robots & ai for warfare.</p>

        <h3 class = "center">The Problem With Job Automation</h3>
        <p>In recent times people have beven finding new ways to make it most cost affective for companies to
rely more on technology rather than employees. The shopping industry is a huge example of this with the 
introduction of new self-checkouts replacing people scanning items.</p>

        <h4 class = "center">Positives Of Job Automation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It doesn't cost as much as hiring and managing employees</li>
            <li>They do not need to take breaks & schedules are not needed</li>
            <li>Computers rule out human error & can ensure something doesn't go wrong</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class = "center">Negatives Of Job Automation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It will take people out of the job and leave them unemployed</li>
            <li>They are expensive & may cost a lot to maintain</li>
        <li>Errors in the code can be fatal & cause issues that could be detected by humans</li>
        <li>The machines still need supervision and commonly need humans to fix issues</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class = "center">The Problem With Deepfaking & New Visual Technology</h3>
        <p>Another immerging problem is the increasingly powerful tech when it comes to visual technology,
the game & film industries get more and more close to real life with every year that passes to the point
where sometimes it is hard to tell. This can cause many issues such as to not being able to see the gap between
reality and can cause people to not know if something on the media is real. People could effectively make
someone do anything they wanted.</p>

        <h4 class = "center">Positives Of Visual Technology</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It allows more immersive experience for the film / game</li>
            <li>Allows characters who are not available to still be shown with deepfaking</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class = "center">Negatives Of Visual Technology</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>It makes it possible to impersonate people easier</li>
            <li>If used in VR, it can make it hard to tell whats reality and whats not</li>
            <li>Make fake media seem more real and harder to differenciate</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="column">
        <h3 class = "center">The Problem With AI & Robotic Warefare</h3>
        <p>Recently lots of governments have started experimenting with different types of
AI & Robotics to be used in warfare. This is one of the biggest ethical concerns for
me, if a AI has the choice between killing and not killing someone it is frightening
as a non-living object is deciding who should live. This can go wrong in many ways and
whatever they do try must be severely tested before used. I beleive this is also one of
the biggest concerns the public have and are scared of what could become of the future.</p>

        <h4 class = "center">Positives of AI & Robotic Warfare</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Less human lives are lost fighting in wars</li>
            <li>Human Error could be removed as a possibility of death</il>
        </ul>

        <h4 class = "center">Negatives of AI & Robotic Warfare</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>If something goes wrong it is extremely dangerous</il>
            <li>Potential hacking or interferance with robots can cause many issues</il>
            <li>People will likely not trust robots with weapons and may protest</il>
        </ul>
