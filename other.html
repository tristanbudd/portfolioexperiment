                                <p class="grey">Gamification makes normal tasks more enjoyable, A great example to start this is by talking about McDonalds Monopoly, with this you are not only getting the food to eat but you are competing with many other customers around the world to win a wide range of prizes. This generates a huge number of sales for McDonalds as it has lots of people visiting to try and win these prizes and interests the buyer more as for every piece of food, they get they can peel a ticket to potentially win something. To make it even more interesting, this year they decided to also give everyone a second chance at winning something from their website and in general they sometimes make it so that you win tickets which require other tickets in order to win. This will make the buyer more likely to return to try and find the other ticket and complete the collection in order to win the prize. </p>

                                <h3 class="white">Whistleblowing</h3>
                                <p class="grey">Whistleblowing is a way of bringing matters of public interest to the public, If a company is doing something against the law, unethical or just wrong you can talk about it and you will have protection from the law to not be treated differently against by the company. Simpler factors such as personal disagreements are not classed as whistleblowing and you can't talk badly about your managers with protection. However for example if a company is changing the expiry dates or doing something that can be dangerous it can be brought to light.<br />Research On Whistleblowers:<br /><br />Frances Haugen - Frances was a data engineer and scientist at Facebook. She discovered thousands of internal documents to the securities and exchange comission and the wall street journal in 2021. She leaked the governments and proved that Facebook repeately prioritied "Growth Over Saftey".<br /><br />Tyler Schultz - Tyler worked for a company called Theranos which was looking to create blood testing that can do over 300 tests with just one sample of blood. He would later find that it was a complete lie and no such testing machine was possible to the scale of what the company was looking to do. When doing testing they took samples and ran individual tests in the background and after whistleblowing the company was exposed and lost almost all of its value as well as the CEO facing charges for fraud.<br />Cher Scarlett - She was the leader of the #AppleToo movement which was the gathering of shared Apple Employee experiences. They all had claims of Harassment & other forms of mistreatment in the workplace and she gained protection from the laws of whistleblowing.</p>
